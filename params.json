You can zoom and d√©zoom the map and move it.\r\n* Put a machine on listening (Sniffing his network trafic)\r\n* You can save a copy of the map to show and manipulate it later\r\n* You can make a finger OS printing and a port scan of the machine of you want\r\n\r\nTechnologies used for Net Polling:\r\n* Arp-scan\r\n* Nmap\r\n* Tshark\r\n* Scapy\r\n* Django\r\n* Python 2.7\r\n* Sqlite\r\n* Javascript\r\n* Jquery\r\n* Bootstrap\r\n\r\n### For the Net Polling server you need :\r\n* 2 interfaces network, one for the scan network and an other for the mirroring port to analyze the bandwidth\r\n* A Debian system like\r\nYou can take a physical server or vmware to do this. With vmware you can do mirroring port\r\n \r\n### To launch Net Polling after the download, you must do it :\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo python /opt/netpolling/install.py\r\n$ sudo python /opt/netpolling/launch.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information, you can contact me on :\r\n* damdam.gold@gmail.com\r\n* [my linkedin](fr.linkedin.com/pub/damien-goldenberg/67/347/a7/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
